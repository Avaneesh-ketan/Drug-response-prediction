# Drug-response-prediction
The Drug Repsonse Prediction project was done while I was introduced and learning Keras.
A particular drug might responsd differently to each and every person w.r.t various factors. The factor we considered was the age. It is a single variabl prediction where age is the only parameter we considered. 
The drug responds differently to age groups 13-65 and 65-older.
